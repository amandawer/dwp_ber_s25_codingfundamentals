# Lessson 1

Using `print()` function:
1. Print `Hello World!` by using the `print()` 
2. Print `My name is <INSERT YOUR NAME HERE>`  
3. Save your changes on codespaces (It's ok if you forgot how to do it, then, go the Class material, Slide 57 to 61)
4. Stop running codespaces (it's very important to not consume all your free monthly credits!)
5. Share `lesson-1/main.py` link into L1 Assignment section on Google Classroom

Have fun! ðŸŽ‰
